Hyperspace Maintenance Wizards (Prototype Edition)

This is a WIP repo to test two specific theories:

1) Good Game Design *can* be done by committee
2) Great Design *must* be done by committee, in the shoulders of giants sense.

The plan for this prototype is to unify ideas expressed in the [upstream release announcement](https://itch.io/jam/open-jam-2022/topic/2445141/hyperspace-maintenance-wizards) as well as the [downstream release announcement](https://www.redhat.com/en/compiler-podcast/building-a-common-language)

The timeline for this prototype has a soft deadline for submission to [SeedComp Round 1](https://itch.io/jam/seed-comp-1-planting) and a harder deadline around the time of [SeedComp Round 2](https://itch.io/jam/seed-comp-1-growing).
